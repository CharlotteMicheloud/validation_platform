        Statistical packages implement statistical or machine learning algorithms.
        Published refers to the method being publishin in a peer-reviewed journal.
        Non-statistical packages are used for e.g. reporting.
      options:
        - Statistical; published
        - Statistical; non-published
        - Non-statistical
      default: 0
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: input
    id: nr_dependencies
    attributes:
      label: Number of dependencies
      description: Use `validation::get_n_deps(pkgname)` in R. If that does not work, check the depends and imports fields of the DESCRIPTION file.
      placeholder: e.g. 15
    validations:

        ### Documentation
        This section covers the degree of documentation of the package
  - type: dropdown
    id: source_code_documented
    attributes:
      label: Is source code available, accessible and documented (i.e., well-structured and including comments) or is the source code unavailable or not clearly commented.
      options:
        - "Yes"
        - "No"
      description: |
        Source code availability refers to it being in a public repository somewhere.
        Needing to use R to get to the source code (e.g. by typing a function name without brackets/parentheses) is insufficient.
          - explanatory comments in the code are a good sign
          - roxygen comments for internal functions is a good sign
          - well structured code (lines, indentation, readability) is a good sign
          - commented-out 'old' code is a bad sign
        Source code that is not commented or difficult to follow is considered not documented (No)
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: input
    id: downloads
    attributes:
      label: Number of downloads in the last 12 months
      description: |
        Use `validation::get_12month_downloads(pkgname)` in R.
        Note that download statistics are only available for packages on CRAN or Bioconductor.
        If download statistics are unavailable, leave it blank.

    id: bug_reporting_active
    attributes:
      label: Bug reporting address is available (in DESCRIPTION)

    attributes:
      label: Does the package have one or more vignettes?
      options:
        - "Yes"
        - "No"
      description: |
        Vignettes are documents that provide a narrative about the package and its use.
        There is a dedicated section on CRAN which lists them. If source code is available,
        they are found in the vignettes folder. They are typically listed under Articles on
        package websites built with pkgdown.
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: dropdown
    id: has_tests

        - Yes, comprehensive
        - Yes, but not comprehensive
