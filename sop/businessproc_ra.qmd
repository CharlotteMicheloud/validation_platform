This is an explanation and ‘dictionary’ for the High Level Risk Assessment tool of the platform.

The file is structured as a process following the steps below:

![](fig/hl_ra.png)

The variables of decision are:

::: {style="color:#5b9bd5;"}
-	Risk area:
-	Risk Subarea
-	Impact of risk (A): 
    -	Minor (1 point)
    -	Major (3 points)
    -	Critical (6 points)
-	Likelihood (A): how likely is the event to take place (before mitigating actions are in place):
    -	Unlikely (1 points)
    -	Possible (2 points)
    -	Likely (3 points)
-	Risk A = multiplication of impact x likelihood
-	Risk A category: categorization of Risk according to points received in Risk A
    -	1-2: Low (green)
    -	3-8: Medium (yellow)
    -	≥9 High (red)
-	Detectability A: how fast and easily is the risk effect detected, potentially before consequences (before mitigating actions are in place):
    -	High (easy to detect, ‘jumps’ to the eye immediately)
    -	Medium (is detectable if one pays attention or examines this point specifically with a critical eye)
    -	Low (hard to detect, only detectable if rigorously and specifically looking for problems)
-	Priority A: The ‘final’ risk category and priority in need for handling (i.e., before mitigating actions). Is conditional on the Risk-A category and on the Detectability A according to the PharmaSUG suggestion (Figure 2) using for “risk class” the defined Risk Category A

::: {style="color:#ed7d31;"}
-	Risk treatment: the mitigating actions that can be implemented. Examples of possibilities are provided. Mitigating actions may:
  -	Reduce the likelihood of a risk to occur
  -	Increase the likelihood of detection of the risk occurring

:::

::: {style="color:#70ad47;"}
-	Risk analysis after treatment:
-	Impact = the same as the impact in the risk assessment (does not change)
-	Likelihood B: The likelihood of the risk to happen (Once mitigating actions are in place)
-	Risk B: the calculated risk based on impact and the new likelihood
-	Detectability B: the new detectability (Once mitigating actions are in place)
-	Priority B: Final, residual, priority of the risk (once mitigating actions are in place)
:::

::: {style="color:#cc66ff;"}
-	Risk monitoring: TO BE FILLED per CTU according to local SOPs and guidelines (local QM)
