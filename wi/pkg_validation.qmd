This page functions as the work instruction for the risk assessment of R 
packages within the SCTO Statistics & Methodology Platform framework. 

In order to perform a risk assessment: 

- **first, check whether the package has already been risk assessed**. This can be done by any of the following methods:
  - the `check_session` function from the [R package `validation`](https://swissclinicaltrialorganisation.github.io/validation/){target="_blank"} can be used from within your R session to check if a package has been risk assessed.
  - check the table on the [Package assessment page](../results/pkgassessment.qmd){target="_blank"} of this site
  - check for the package in the [package validation GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/pkg_validation/issues){target="_blank"} by searching for it among the issues using the search bar towards the top of the page (remember to remove the is:open filter). E.g. to search for dplyr, the search might be `is:issue dplyr`
- **if it has been risk assessed**, check the associated risk and consider whether any functions within package need additional testing for your use case.
- **if it has not been risk assessed**, go to the [package validation GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/pkg_validation/issues){target="_blank"}
  - click the green "New issue" button (towards the top right)
  - select the New package risk assessment template by clicking the green Get started button on the right
  - fill in the form, following the instructions provided. Additional notes on the risk metrics can be found on the [Risk metrics page](../sop/risk_metrics.qmd).
    - Note that the [R package `validation`](https://swissclinicaltrialorganisation.github.io/validation/){target="_blank"} contains various useful functions to help with the risk assessment process. Especially useful are:
      - `get_n_deps`, which returns the number of dependencies of a package,
      - `get_12month_downloads` which returns the number of downloads of a package in the last 12 months, and 
      - `get_release_date` finds the release date of a package.
  - Once you have completed the form, click the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom of the page.
  - Submitting the form will trigger an automated job that will calculate the risk based on the information you entered into the form and post a comment on the issue.
